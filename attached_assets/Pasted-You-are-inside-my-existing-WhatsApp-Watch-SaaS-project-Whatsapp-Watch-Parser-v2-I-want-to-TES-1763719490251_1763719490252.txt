You are inside my existing WhatsApp Watch SaaS project: "Whatsapp-Watch-Parser-v2".

I want to TEST mBlaster's /api/send endpoint from THIS app (not a separate test project), using the SAME pattern that already works on Railway and Render.

Here are the mBlaster credentials to use FOR TESTING ONLY:

- instance_id: 691AAD3AACBF7
- access_token: 6823295cdd694
- test number: 917021542840 (no +, includes country code)

My goal: add a simple TEST endpoint in this app:

  GET /api/test-mblaster

When I open /api/test-mblaster in the browser (on the Replit public URL), it should:

1. Make a POST request to:
   https://mblaster.in/api/send

2. Use this JSON body:
   {
     "number": "917021542840",
     "type": "text",
     "message": "Test from Replit SaaS app",
     "instance_id": "691AAD3AACBF7",
     "access_token": "6823295cdd694"
   }

3. Read the raw text response from mBlaster.

4. If the response LOOKS LIKE HTML (starts with "<" and contains "<html"), then respond from /api/test-mblaster with:
   {
     "ok": false,
     "reason": "HTML_RESPONSE",
     "statusCode": <HTTP status>,
     "bodySample": "<first 200 characters of the response>"
   }

5. Otherwise, try to parse it as JSON. If JSON parse succeeds, respond with:
   {
     "ok": true,
     "statusCode": <HTTP status>,
     "parsedJson": <parsed JSON>,
     "rawSample": <omit or short sample>
   }

6. If JSON parse fails (but it's not HTML), then respond with:
   {
     "ok": true,
     "statusCode": <HTTP status>,
     "parsedJson": null,
     "rawSample": "<first 200 characters>"
   }

Very important requirements:

- Do NOT break any existing routes or logic.
- Follow the existing Express/TypeScript structure of this project.
- If there is already a central Express app file (for example server/index.ts, server/app.ts, or similar), mount the new route there in the same style as other routes (e.g. under /api).
- You may create a small new route module if that matches the current structure (for example in server/routes/test-mblaster.ts), or you can add the handler into an existing "secure" route file if that’s how the app is organized. Just keep it clean and consistent.

Technical details:
- Use whatever HTTP client the project is already using (axios, node-fetch, or fetch). If axios is already used in server/routes/whatsapp-secure.ts or similar, please reuse it. Do NOT introduce a big new dependency if not needed.
- Make sure the /api/test-mblaster route compiles in TypeScript and is wired correctly into the Express app.
- You can keep instance_id, access_token, and number hard-coded for now in this TEST route only. I understand this is not ideal for production, but this is JUST to test connectivity from Replit.

After you implement this:

1. Run the server in the Repl.
2. Tell me the full public URL of the Repl (e.g., https://xxx.yyy.repl.co).
3. Internally, YOU call GET /api/test-mblaster (from within the Replit webview or a simple HTTP client).
4. Show me the EXACT JSON response returned by /api/test-mblaster so I can see whether mBlaster responded with "status":"success" JSON or with HTML.

Do NOT refactor unrelated parts of the app. Only add the minimal test route and wire it in.
